## How to set-up this project so that both next.js and rails are working properly

1. Install Next.js and Rails (including bundler, watch tutorial about how to do this because it can be complicated)
2. git clone this repository
3. Once you are in, then run "cd frontend/"
4. run "npm install"
5. run "npm run dev" and open up localhost:3000 on your browser. 
6. run "cd .. " to go back to the main direectory
7. run "cd backend/"
8. run "bundle" to install all of the gems (gems are like dependencies)
9. run "rails s" to start the server
10. If both servers are working, we should be good to go!!
